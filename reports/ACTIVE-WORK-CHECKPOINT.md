# Gate integration — 2026-10-24

Repo /Users/home/github/game, branch codex/gate-ground-integration from fresh origin/main 284f3c2. Main contains portal teleport and local ground life. Preserve untracked reports/NEW-CHAT-HANDOFF.md.

Current explicit task authorizes intermediate commits and asks for npm test green before final report. Scope is rendering only: keep accepted frontal Gate art, source geometry/anchor, PATH, GATE_D, slots, combat and balance. Integration criteria: irregular mud/route overlap at base, matching organic growth climbing lower stone, soft ground shadow, cyan spill on nearby ground and bodies within ~80px, zone grading for Mire and Ember.

Baseline captures prepared with tools/capture-gate-integration.cjs (loadWorld from actual native game renderer), both zones. Next: cached Gate surface grading and irregular footing/ground growth, shadow/spill and body-only light. Preserve the full lane width and the teleport effect. Save intermediate code, inspect actual close/whole shots for both zones, add focused tests and run npm test. No push/merge requested.

## Implementation in progress

Baseline committed as 3e7e28f. Implemented cached display-only Gate grading (warm stone/moss in Ember, muted olive in Mire; cyan aperture preserved), irregular feathering of bottom alpha, six narrow world-texture roots on lower masonry, soft forward shadow and 80px cyan ground/body spill. Sprite lighting uses one reusable 128px alpha mask and preserves body transparency/texture. Projection, source assets, all Gate geometry and combat unchanged.

Focused portal-entry, organic-world and forager-mire tests passed for the first implementation. Visual inspection caught an unlit brown burial patch pasted over the new ground light beneath Foragers. Now paintGateApproach paints the same floor/shadow/light into the creature contact surface; recapturing to inspect correction. Need dedicated gate tests, whole/close/grayscale review and final npm test. No final approval yet.

## Integrated render checkpoint

Brown burial artifact corrected and final Mire/Ember captures regenerated. Opened both close-ups, Ember whole scene and Mire grayscale; accepted frontal silhouette and broad approach retained. tests/gate-integration.cjs passes both zones: exact baseline rules/combat/geometry, unchanged upper silhouette, cyan preservation, feathered bottom, warm Ember grading, 80px range, actual body lighting for all three castes and matching lit-floor samples. Tests account for the original image's 249–253 interior alpha. Final npm test pending. No push or merge.

## Completed implementation / awaiting user visual review

Full npm test passed on b67293d (all tests passed); subsequent changes are documentation only. git diff --check clean. Intermediate commits: 3e7e28f baseline, b67293d implementation and native visual tests. Final report/PR text in reports/gate-integration/README.md and PR.md; before/after full and close images for Mire/Ember plus grayscale views included. Source art files untouched. Native rendering validated; browser/device performance not assessed. Final artistic approval remains with the user.

No push, PR creation or merge performed. User can checkout codex/gate-ground-integration, inspect, push and create PR using the report's commands. A three-commit git-am delivery patch is saved after the final documentation commit at reports/generated/gate-ground-integration.patch; do not reapply it to this already-completed branch. Preserve untracked user reports/NEW-CHAT-HANDOFF.md. No remaining implementation task unless user feedback requests changes.
